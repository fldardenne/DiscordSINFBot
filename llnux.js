// Once upon a time in our little galaxy far away, a little kap had access to the private account of Obiwac
// Some would it's a bad idea, other would say it's the opportunity to shine.
// I would say it's the opportunity to deploy the awesome opportunity to present the awesome person
// able to keep the world moving.
// While it's a difficult place to live, it's still the perfect location to understand the human being that 
// wandering inside what we call, our world.
// Please enjoy and try to understand every human being you meet. They are all complex and moved by some
// difficult motivation.
